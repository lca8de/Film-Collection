#Film-Collection
#This was the first website that I ever built and it was for an individual project for a Web and Mobile class.  For this school project, we were allowed to use free templates from the internet.
#I used a free template but I also edited it and changed it in order to look how I wanted it to look and to accomodate the information that I wanted to present.  
#The theme of this project was "I can track it", so, being a movie lover, I decided to keep track of the films I owned and films I wanted to purchase.  
#I had to use many different technologies throughout this project, including: HTML, CSS, JQUERY, Ajax, MySQL, and JavaScript.
#This was built in around 7 weeks.
